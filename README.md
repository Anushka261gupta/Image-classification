# 🧠 Image Classification using Deep Learning  
This project implements an end-to-end image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) along with advanced preprocessing techniques to improve model accuracy and robustness.

---

## 📌 **1. Overview**
The goal of this project is to build a reliable and efficient **image classification pipeline**.  
It includes:
- Image preprocessing  
- Data augmentation  
- Deep learning model training  
- Evaluation using metrics & visualizations  

This project can classify images into multiple classes (e.g., benign vs malignant / cat vs dog / any custom dataset).

---

## 🧹 **2. Preprocessing Pipeline**
The following image enhancement steps are applied:

### ✔ Resize → 224×224  
### ✔ Adaptive Power-Law (Gamma) Correction  
- Dark images → brightened  
- Bright images → softened  
- Helps normalize uneven lighting

### ✔ ACCLAHE (Advanced CLAHE)  
- Enhances contrast  
- Preserves edges  
- Prevents over-amplification

### ✔ Data Augmentation  
- Random Horizontal Flip  
- Rotation  
- Color Jitter  
- Helps avoid overfitting

### ✔ Normalization  
Standard ImageNet mean & std.

## 🧠 **3. Model Architecture**
A custom CNN architecture is used (simplified):

- Convolution Layers  
- ReLU  
- Batch Normalization  
- Max Pooling  
- Dropout  
- Fully Connected Layers  
- Softmax Output  

The architecture is optimized for small-to-medium datasets.

## 📂 **4. Dataset Structure**
The dataset follows this structure:

```
dataset/
│── train/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
│
└── test/
    ├── class_1/
    ├── class_2/
```

(Works for any number of classes.)

## 🚀 **5. Training**
To train the model:

```
